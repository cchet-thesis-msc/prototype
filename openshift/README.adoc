= Openshift Resources for managing the Openshift Project

This document describes the implemented Openshift Resources for managing the Openshift Project, which hosts the monitoring service, security services and ESB services.

The Openshift Resources and scripts have been split into the two directories 

* __esb-infra__, which holds the infrastructure related resources, and
* __esb__, which holds the ESB service related resources.

Due to the fact, that ``oc cluster up`` created Openshift Clusters don't have a proper network plugin, it is not possible to create two separate Openshift Projects, whereby the POD networks of the projects are joined.
