# Prototype ESB in Openshift with Fuse Integration Services 2.0

This repository holds the prototype for the master thesis __Implementation of an Enterprise Service Bus with OpenShift__
which is public available on link:++https://github.com/cchet-thesis-msc/thesis++[Github]. The prototype uses the RedHat tooling __Fuse Integration Services 2.0__ which consists of
a Maven Plugin (Fabric8) and Openshift Builder-Images, which allow to manage a integration service
via a Maven Build. This readme provides introductions to setup and run the prototype on a
Windows 10 Host. +

## Windows 10 Setup
This section will describe the setup of the Windows 10 environment. The following applications and features need
to be enabled, installed and configured. +

. Follow the instructions available link:++https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10++[here] to
  install and enable WSL. During the development, the Ubuntu Linux-Image has been used. +
. Follow the instruction available link:++https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#install-docker-for-windows-desktop-app++[here] to
  install and configure __Docker For Windows__. The installer will ask you to enable **HyperV** Windows-Feature, which will
  prevent VMWare or VirtualBox from working.
. Download link:++https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/++[Python 3.x] for Windows and install it.
.. If not already added during installation process, add Python binaries to Windows $PATH.
.. Install the following Python packages of link:++https://github.com/getwarped/powershift++[Powershift],
   which are used to manage the local Openshift Cluster. Install these packages via ``pip install <PACKAGE_NAME>``.
... __powershift__, is the base package.
... __powershift-cli__, is the base CLI implementation.
... __powershift-cluster__, provides CLI for managing __oc cluster__ created clusters.
... __powershift-image__, provides CLI for managing S2I Images and Builds.

## Docker For Windows Setup
This section will describe the setup of Docker for Windows.

. Go to __General__ and enable **Expose daemon via tcp://...**, so that WSL can access the Docker Daemon.
. Go to __Advanced__ and setup the available CPU and Memory. **(CPU: 7, RAM 7GB, DISK 112GB)**
. Go to __Daemon__ and add the private registry **172.30.0.0/16**.
. Go to __Daemon__ enable **Advanced Features** and add JSON-Property **"selinux-enabled": false**

**There was a problem with OC 3.9, where the router pod didn't start because there was not enough memory !!!!** +

The Docker Daemon can now be accessed via the exposed URL, which will be done via the WSL. The private registry
is used by Openshift for storing Docker Images and selinux is disabled, because there is no way to get into the backing VM of Docker For Windows.

## WSL setup
This section will describe the setup of the WSL environment.

. Execute ``sudo apt install docker.io`` to install Docker on Ubunto 18.04 WSL-Image.
. Add ``export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2375`` to ``~/.bashrc`` to point to Windows Docker-Daemon. Don't use **localhost**
  because this points to WSL localhost.

Docker commands executed in the WSL, will actual be executed on the Windows Docker-Host, which is
located in a HyperV VM.

## Repository Structure
This section will describe the structure of the prototype repository, which holds all needed resources. +

* **.idea** is the IntelliJ directory holding IntelliJ Run-Configurations.
* **/docker** is the directory which holds all Docker relevant resources.
* **/docker/<SERVICE_NAME>** is the directory holding all service relevant Openshift related resources.
* **/openshift** is the directory which contains all Openshift relevant resource, which are managed outside of
  the integration service code bases.
* **/openshift/<SERVICE_NAME>** is the directory holding all service relevant Openshift related resources.
* **/services** is the directory holding the service code bases
* **/services/<SERVICE_NAME>** is the directory holding the service related code base.

The service code bases are completely separated from each other and would normally reside in their own repositories, but
for demonstration purpose all resources where kept in one repository. See the following links for the documentation
of the different parts of the prototype. +

* link:openshift/README.adoc[Openshift Project Management] holds the documentation of the implemented resources, which manage
  a Openshift Project.
* link:services/README.adoc[Integration Service Implementation] holds the documentation of the implemented integration services.
